1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To interact with github:

go to github and create an empty repository.

then, in bash use the following command, to add the repository on github as a
remote:
git remote add origin [url]
the url can be found in the repository on github
I could use any name instead of "origin". It's the name I will use in this
repository to refer to the repository on github. If I only have one remote, it's
standard to name it "origin"
A remote in my local repository is basically a reference to another repository.

git remote        - see the remote repositories created

to verify that the url was added correctly - use the following command to get
the verbose (-v) information from the remote:

git remote -v

In order to send my changes to the remote:
git push [remote_to_which_I_send_changes] [local_branch_to_be_pushed]

Pull from github (pull all commits reachable from the specified branch on
github):
git pull [remote_name] [branch_I_want_to_pull]
e.g.:
git pull origin master
